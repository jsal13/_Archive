# Emulator

The only thing you currently need is an emulator.  We recommend getting [Bizhawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory.html) which will allow you to use the **EmuHawk** emulator.  This will allow you to run games on a number of different consoles.

**See the sections [here](https://wiki.sneak.bike/en/runners/setup) on getting and setting up the emulator.**

For racers who do not want to use or cannot use bizhawk, we will give the system out a bit beforehand.  Let us know if you need help finding alternative emulators.
