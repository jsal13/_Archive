<h1>TL;DR:</h1>
<p>0. Consider the level of runner.<br>1. Pick a format.<br>2. Pick a console.<br>3. Pick some game(s), figure out good objectives.<br>4. Check with a Sneakops member to make sure it's good.<br>5. Iterate if necessary from the critiques of the previous step.<br>6. Bundle game + readme&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Step 0: What level race is it?</h1>
<p>For beginners, we try to "be kind" and get them immersed in a game they may not have ever played before.&nbsp; While an intermediate runner may easily sweep through the first four worlds of Super Mario Bros, it may not be the case for beginner runners.&nbsp; Keep this in mind when picking games and objectives.</p>
<p>While there are no hard-and-fast rules, we have some general guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Beginner:</strong> Generally, we want to be nice, pick games which are perhaps less obscure / less nintendo-hard, and games which are "fun" over "frustrating".</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong>: Generally, we want to pick games which are a bit harder, a bit more obscure, and which have goals which are more challenging.&nbsp; These individuals will have played a number of retro games and know the tropes; they'll be able to figure things out faster so there is less time spent on learning the controls and objectives compared to the beginner racers.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Step 1: Pick a Format.</h1>
<p>We have a few different formats at Sneakbike, each have varying levels of difficulty to set up, run, and pick for.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single-Game Races</strong>: A single-game race consists of one game which should last around 40—60 minutes.&nbsp; The idea here is to have the runners spend a lot of time immersing themselves in one particular game to get interested / learn the lore / master the controls / get pretty far.<ul>
      <li>Games which work well are: <strong>RPGs, Platformers.</strong></li>
      <li>Games which may work better in another format: <strong>Shoot'em'ups, Beat'em'ups, Puzzle Games.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Two-Game Race with Intermission</strong>: (<i>The most common format.)</i> Two game races should last around 50—70 minutes for gameplay (not including intermission).&nbsp; The format is: the runners play one game, then intermission, then the players play the second game.&nbsp; All runners start at the same time for both games.&nbsp; This is a good format if you'd like one mid-size game and one short game, e.g. some puzzle game and some platformer.</li>
  <li><strong>Three-Game Relay:</strong> Three games are chosen and should last around 50—70 minutes.&nbsp; There is no intermission, and the runners go from one game to the next as in a relay.&nbsp; This is the most involved race for production and commentating, so use only when you have a good plan in mind and when the games will jive with one-another nicely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Step 2: Pick a Console.</h1>
<p>While multi-console is possible, we typically opt to stick with one console at a time for ease of runner setup. &nbsp;You can do multi-console if you've got a good idea or something, though!</p>
<p>There is no real restriction here, see what games we have and what is available to emulate on BizHawk.&nbsp; For now, we try to avoid things like N64 (controller requirements) or PS1 (it's always great to emulate) and consoles after that.</p>
<h1>Step 3: Pick some game(s), figure out an objective.</h1>
<p>This is often the most difficult part: the objective should be short enough that the skill-level you're working with has a chance to complete it in the time allotted, but NOT short enough such that people are done in half that time.&nbsp; Obviously, we are unable to see how much the runner knows, but here are some good general guidelines we've found to be helpful:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Know thy level</i>: play the game yourself and time yourself on the objective, then approximate how others of the relevant skill level would do. &nbsp;You may want to say, “I'm an intermediate, so Beginners might take double the time on this game," for example.</li>
  <li><i>Ask someone else</i>: get the help of a Sneakops (or someone not racing) and see how they do.&nbsp; You may better approximate objectives from this.</li>
  <li><i>Make Good Objectives: </i>pick an objective which is easy to understand and which a reasonable runner will know when it is complete while racing: beating stages, killing bosses, etc., are good examples of good objectives.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Step 4: Check with a Sneakops when you've got an idea.</h1>
<p>Once you've got a plan, let us know and we'll see how reasonable it is.&nbsp; Most of the time we'll iterate on your idea after trying it out.</p>
<h1>Step 5: Iterate.</h1>
<p>If necessary, a Sneakops might say something like, "This is fine, but if we have to extend it, what would a stretch goal be…?" or "What about if we did XYZ instead?"&nbsp; Often, we'll think about “mercy kill” strategies where we can make the objective easier during the race if we begin to run long. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We iterate on the ideas until an objective is agreed upon.</p>
<h1>Step 6: README Bundling.</h1>
<p>Once the objectives and games are agreed upon, fill out the important parts of the <a href="https://jsalv.com/app/readme-gen">README Generator</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, please try to fill out some parts of the <a href="https://jsalv.com/app/gamepicker-game-info">Game Info Tool</a> for the commentators, to give them some quick links about the game to check out. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once you have these two HTML files, give them to the Sneakops and they'll distribute it to everyone who needs it, along with the ROM files.</strong></p>
<p>That's it!</p>
