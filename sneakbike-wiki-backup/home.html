<h1>What <i>is</i> Sneakbike?</h1>
<p>Sneakbike is a community of people working towards two primary goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>: Making friends, being nice to each other, and friendly competition.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning New Skills</strong>: A commitment to helping each other grow and learn new things.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What does Sneakbike do?</h1>
<p>The Sneakbike Community currently hosts two different events: <i>Sneakbike Mystery Races</i> and <i>Sneakly Weeklys</i>.</p>
<h2>Sneakbike Mystery Races</h2>
<p><strong>Mystery Races are events where four similarly-skilled players race to complete an objective</strong> in one, two,or three "mystery games" which are only revealed to the runners a few minutes before the race starts!</p>
<h2>Sneakly Weeklys</h2>
<p>This is the Sneakbike Community's "anything goes" event. It's a good time to try out some new event ideas or to have a community night.</p>
<p>In the past we've had <i>non-mystery races, casual playthroughs of weird games, learning a speedrun together, teaching streams, learning randomizer games, hollow knight randomizer bingo</i>, and sometimes we just hang out and play games together.</p>
