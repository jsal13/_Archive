<h2>Idea and Intro</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two*</strong> runners are given (right before the race) <strong>one* mystery game.</strong></li>
  <li>We give them an objective for the game. &nbsp;This can be a bingo card, a standard objective, etc.</li>
  <li>They must cooperate (most likely via discord call) to learn the game mechanics together and <strong>both must beat the objective</strong> for them to “win”.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that they will double as commentators, so we will have to make sure to enforce the PG-13 rule.</p>
<p><strong>*The asterisk means that these values are negotiable.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What would be needed?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two*</strong> runners (acting as runners and commentators)</li>
  <li>One producer</li>
  <li>One veteran comm to intro and conclude</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that these values are not distinct: the runner could also be the producer, the producer could be the veteran comm, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Potential Extensions.</h2>
<p>In order to satisfy “but what about if we do (bigger thing)?” we'll note the following here: <strong>once we prove that we can do an event like this, we can extend it to two teams of two which have the same objectives but where these two teams are racing one-another</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This becomes more complex in terms of both visual and audio components, so we'd like to build up to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Ops] FAILSAFES: What do we do if one of the runners just “isn't working out"?</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Ops] Interested party to try this out. &nbsp;Maybe we ought to do a sample of this some other day to see if it works nice? &nbsp;Idk.</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Ops] Runners that we think would have chemistry. &nbsp;In this event it is MUCH more important that the runners feel comfortable with each other and have chemistry, lest we have an hour or so of awkward non-chatter.</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Ops] How do we vet runners above?</span></label></li>

  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Gamepicker] A single game good for this sort of thing, and an objective / set of objectives for the runners to do.</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Gamepicker / Ops] How much info about the game do we give them? &nbsp;Do we give them a manual? &nbsp;Do we let them read that before, or should one of them have to read the manual during the event? &nbsp;Etc.</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">&nbsp;[Gamepicker / Ops] What kind of games? &nbsp;We can start with retro ROMs but we can pret much do whatever here.</span></label></li>
</ul>
